## What is kubernetes in nutshell?

Letâ€™s say you created an application(e.g Pokemon go) and decided to share it with the world. How can you do that? by deploying it to the internet. So you deployed this application into 5 different servers using docker. And your application starts getting massive traffic even you are not imagined. Millions of users started using. You are happy on one side simultaneously you are sad because you have to scale up the servers because 5 are not enough for such massive traffic. Now you need to scale up fast and make sure all containers restart if they die. And you will be gone out of control.
This is where Kubernetes comes into play.
